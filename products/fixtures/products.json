Thanks to this ultra-reliable business inkjet multifunction printer, users can print up to 20,000 pages without needing to change supplies.<br><br><b>High yield printing</b><br>This low-intervention MFP prints up to 20,000 pages in mono or colour without changing the ink supplies. This means there is low user intervention, increasing productivity.<br><br><b>Precision Core Heat-free technology</b><br>Epson Heat-Free Technology requires no heat to warm up when it is switched on or woken from sleep, which significantly reduces energy consumption and therefore saves money. This also means Epson's Heat-Free inkjets can deliver a fast first page out time (FPOT) of 5.5 seconds compared to laser printers, which need to preheat the fuser to print.<br><br><b>Enhance functionality with in-house (EDA, EPA) and third party solutions (Open Platform)</b><br>Gain complete control of printing operations with Epson and its partners solutions, allowing devices to be set up to meet specific and changing business requirements.<br><br><b>Epson Remote Services (ERS)</b><br>Our cloud-based device monitoring and management system helps service providers to perform accurate remote diagnosis without compromising on security. The embedded agent on the WF-C878R allows for seamless setup and use.",

Thanks to this ultra-reliable business inkjet multifunction printer, users can print up to 20,000 pages without needing to change supplies.<br><br><b>High yield printing</b><br>This low-intervention MFP prints up to 20,000 pages in mono or colour without changing the ink supplies. This means there is low user intervention, increasing productivity.<br><br><b>Precision Core Heat-free technology</b><br>Epson Heat-Free Technology requires no heat to warm up when it is switched on or woken from sleep, which significantly reduces energy consumption and therefore saves money. This also means Epson's Heat-Free inkjets can deliver a fast first page out time (FPOT) of 5.5 seconds compared to laser printers, which need to preheat the fuser to print.<br><br><b>Enhance functionality with in-house (EDA, EPA) and third party solutions (Open Platform)</b><br>Gain complete control of printing operations with Epson and its partners solutions, allowing devices to be set up to meet specific and changing business requirements.<br><br><b>Epson Remote Services (ERS)</b><br>Our cloud-based device monitoring and management system helps service providers to perform accurate remote diagnosis without compromising on security.

Imagine losing your personal files, leaving them on a train or in the back of a taxi, knowing that anyone can access them because they were saved on a standard USB drive. The Fingerprint Secure USB Drive uses a combination of AES 256-bit hardware encryption and biometric technology for complete information security. <br><br><b>High-level Encryption</b><br>The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the drive in real-time. The drive is compliant with GDPR requirements as 100% of the drive is securely encrypted. The built-in fingerprint recognition system allows access for up to six authorised users including one administrator who can access the device via a password. The USB drive does not store passwords in the computer or system's volatile memory making it far more secure than software encryption. Also, if it falls into the wrong hands, the drive will erase all data after multiple failed password attempts. <br><br><b>User-Friendly</b><br>The easy-to-use software allows up to six users to enrol and save their fingerprints. On first use an administrator password is setup and this administrator can setup the other users, assigning them with either administrator or access only rights. Once assigned, these users can lock and unlock the device just using their registered fingerprint. Simply plug in the Fingerprint secure to your PC and gently place your finger on the sensor. If the fingerprint is recognised the secure USB drive will unlock and a blue LED on the device will light up. The USB drive can also be accessed using the administrator password.<br><br><b>Extensive Connectivity</b><br>Compatible with both PC and Mac operating systems, the USB drive has a USB 3.0 interface which can handle speeds up to 5Gbps, whilst also being backwards compatible with USB 2.0 (480Mbps speeds) for use on a variety of host devices.",

In addition, costly repairs as a result of defective print heads and cash register breakdowns are avoided.<br>Likewise, Epson places great emphasis on the choice of ink in which the ribbon is soaked: quality of print out, even distribution of colour along the length of the ribbon and predection of the print head pins from mechanical strain and chemical pollution are the important criteria which influence quality and perfect design.<br>Over and above the design, Epson places great importance on quality assurance during the production process. In doing so, Epson guarantees excellent product properties at all times and an optimum harmonisation with the main product - the Epson printer.",

In addition, costly repairs as a result of defective print heads and cash register breakdowns are avoided.<br>Likewise, Epson places great emphasis on the choice of ink in which the ribbon is soaked: quality of print out, even distribution of colour along the length of the ribbon and predection of the print head pins from mechanical strain and chemical pollution are the important criteria which influence quality and perfect design.<br>Over and above the design, Epson places great importance on quality assurance during the production process.
